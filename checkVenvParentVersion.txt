especially since managing multiple Python versions can get a bit messy without the right checks. Hereâ€™s how you can verify which base Python version a virtual environment is using:
Method 1: 
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate   # On Unix/macOS
# OR
.\path\to\venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

python --version                    # Or python -V

Method 2:

cat /path/to/venv/pyvenv.cfg

Method 3:

Using sys Module
If you're inside the virtual environment and running Python:
import sys
print(sys.version)
print(sys.executable)


Great question, Laxmi â€” especially for someone as methodical and workflow-driven as you. Managing multiple Python versions and environments can quickly spiral into chaos without a structured approach. Hereâ€™s a toolbox of best practices to help you keep everything neat, predictable, and modular:

ðŸ§° 1. Use a Python Version Manager
Tools: pyenv, asdf, conda
- Keep your system Python untouched â€” install alternate versions via these tools.
- Use project-specific Python versions (pyenv local) to avoid global conflicts.
- Set global defaults (pyenv global) to control CLI behavior reliably.

ðŸ“¦ 2. Isolate with Virtual Environments
Tools: venv, virtualenv, pipenv, poetry, or conda envs
- Always create a virtual environment per project.
- Avoid sharing envs across projects â€” it saves you from version mismatches and dependency nightmares.
- Store virtualenvs in project-specific subfolders or dedicated workspace folders for visibility.

ðŸ§¼ 3. Keep Environments Clean
- Use a requirements.txt, Pipfile, or pyproject.toml to declare dependencies explicitly.
- Install only what's needed for the project â€” no global packages unless absolutely necessary.
- Validate with tools like pip check, poetry lock, and black for formatting.

ðŸ—‚ 4. Structure Your Projects
- Keep clear file structures: /src, /tests, /venv, and config files (.flake8, .pre-commit, etc.)
- Version-control everything except the actual virtualenv folder â€” use .gitignore smartly.

ðŸ§ª 5. Automate Environment Setup
- Write a setup script (setup.sh, Makefile, or Python wrapper) to recreate the environment with a single command.
- Use pre-commit hooks for formatting and linting tools to catch issues early.

ðŸš€ Bonus Tip for You
Since you're already working with LangGraph and Gmail API workflows â€” consider using pyenv to manage versions and poetry to encapsulate environments and dependencies. Itâ€™ll streamline your scripting projects and make sharing configs (or Dockerizing later) much easier.
